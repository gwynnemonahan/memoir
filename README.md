Experimenting using GitHub to draft the next version of my memoir

It is June 22, 2022, at 10:34pm local time. Needing a project of some sort, I've decided to experiment with GitHub as I work on the next draft/version of my memoir. To give you a sense of me, my memoir, and the journey, this README is composed of my <b>Artist Statement</b>, which was also a requirement for my <a href="https://www.sierranevada.edu/academics/humanities-social-sciences/mfa-in-creative-writing/" target="_blank">MFA in creative non-fiction from Seirra Nevada University</a> (formerly Sierra Nevada College). 

I should note that issues related to depression and suicidal ideation present in the work. If you or someone you know is struggle, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifline: 800-273-8255

While requests for suggestions, edits, typos, etc. are welcome, I am doubtful anyone will read the manuscript as I post, let alone submit requests, but one never knows when posting things to the internets so we shall see.

# Artist Statement

When asked about my biggest influence, my first answer is Neil Peart’s <i>Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road</i>. His vulnerability is captivating, his writing lyrical, which is understandable as he is the lyricist for the Candian rock band Rush. What first struck me about this particular book is his vulnerability. He puts it all on the page. Pulls no punches. In the process, as a reader you take the journey with him, internally and externally. Through grief, guilt, acceptance, and redemption, in a way. He also uses his journal as part of his manuscript. He keeps a journal on pretty much every ride he takes, and it provides insight into his mind at the time, as well as his routine, sights, sounds, people, experiences. The other thing that struck me is how he weaves through time, expands and dips into memories, pops up as if for air in the present and relays observations and routine. 

For me, it was enough to put words on the page. Having pieces workshopped was certainly helpful, but I couldn’t answer the question: Who wants to read this? It’s dark. It’s depressing. More importantly, if it’s hard for me to write, it will be hard for people to read. Why make people do more work than necessary? As a technical writer by trade, my purpose is to preemptively answer questions by thoroughly documenting the inner workings of an application. Sometimes though, I have to guess at questions, do my best to document the functionality, and revise post-launch. Workshops have functioned in this way for me, bringing to light a story that answers questions people have had that I inadvertently answer. 

My brain functions in terms of logic rather than emotion, so suicidal thinking takes on an analytical bent in my brain, with a lengthy pro/con list. To me, logically and practically, the best way to convey that is to write out the conversations that happen in my brain and the data used by both sides to back up their arguments. As I’ve progressed through the program, the voices have taken center stage.  As a consumer of knowledge, I went looking for examples of this. Graphic novels. Plays. Memoirs. Fiction. History. Most of the time it is expository, description, or summary. They talk of transformation, provide sensory details of what it’s like to live with a mind in the dark. <i>An Unquiet Mind</i>. <i>Darkness Visible</i>. <i>Your Voice, In My Head</i>. <i>Maybe You Should Talk to Someone</i>. <i>The Silent Patient</i>. I am gradually realizing that my analytical mind, on the page, opens a window into what it’s like to be a suicidal thinker, and that has the potential to help change the conversation. I am hesitant to make that proclamation as it seems to add weight to what already feels heavy. At the same time, however, its usefulness cannot be ignored. 

### Writing Process and Lessons
My writing process involves thinking and ruminating. 

My brain functions in a logical, almost scientific manner. It doesn’t allow for simply “telling a story.” There must be a hypothesis and a method. With nonfiction, my process changes. I spend more time ruminating on a subject and scene than I do on forming a hypothesis. My brain shifts into scene mode, as if laying out a shooting schedule for a movie from the barebones of a script that gradually transforms into a vibrant picture. 

My strengths lie in the realm of diction and dialogue, and scenery and imagery. I can describe surroundings very well, the interactions of other people, and paint a vivid picture. I struggle with conveying my internal monologues the same way, and at times I get too down into the muck of details that the point or direction is lost. Other times is runs in the other direction, especially in transition to my internal monologue, and becomes abstract, like I am not ready/willing/able to inhabit or reoccupy certain mental landscapes so the reader is left to do all the work. 

A number of books I’ve read have managed to find some balance in mental space, in the conveyance of time, space, setting, people, something physical to help orient or ground the reader that also helped steer the internal struggles of the author. I have not mastered that yet. 

### The Role of Music and Lyrics in the Manuscript
Music is how my brain operates and communicates with itself, and by extension, me and my interactions with the world. I did not know this until I embarked on this project, and am continually learning the extent, impact, influence, and significance of music in my life. 

In the context of my manuscript, music is a method my brain uses to do battle through 2 bands in particular: Linkin Park and Nickelback. They function as manifestations of the dichotomy that is occuring in my brain. Linkin Park is physical, actionable, and easily skewed toward death. Nickelback evokes feelings, emotions, and their lyrics are open-ended, indicating choice. At this point in the manuscript, my brain is battling over the concept of choice, and the reality that I have choices.

It is only now, near the end of this project (in January 2020), that I am starting to understand that the line “diamond in the rough” from Nickelback's song "Gotta Be Somebody" is Tech Support. Though educated, because it is part of my brain, it is a “diamond in the rough” in the sense that it has good character, albeit buried under decades of bad data. It recognizes this, however, and works to clean and reprocess data while setting up new systems and processes for collecting and analyzing new data. When Nickelback plays in the manuscript, though, my brain is not capable of processing any of this yet, so these particular lyrics are more foreshadowing, preparing me for what’s going to come as Tech Support breaks free from the Prosecution and sets about becoming my ally, my champion.  

Throughout the remainder of the manuscript, other lyrics appear from bands like Alabama 3, Green Day, Three Days Grace, among others. A pattern emerges of physical, actionable lyrics versus more emotionally-driven lyrics, that still holds today.
