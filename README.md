Experimenting using GitHub to draft the next version of my memoir

It is June 22, 2022, at 10:34pm local time. Needing a project of some sort, I've decided to experiment with GitHub as I work on the next draft/version of my memoir. To give you a sense of me, my memoir, and the journey, this README is composed of my <b>Artist Statement</b>, which was also a requirement for my <a href="https://www.sierranevada.edu/academics/humanities-social-sciences/mfa-in-creative-writing/" target="_blank">MFA in creative non-fiction from Seirra Nevada University</a> (formerly Sierra Nevada College). 

While requests for suggestions, edits, typos, etc. are welcome, I am doubtful anyone will read the manuscript as I post, let alone submit requests, but one never knows when posting things to the internets so we shall see.
