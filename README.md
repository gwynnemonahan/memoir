Experimenting using GitHub to draft the next version of my memoir

It is June 22, 2022, at 10:34pm local time. Needing a project of some sort, I've decided to experiment with GitHub as I work on the next draft/version of my memoir.

While requests for suggestions, edits, typos, etc. are welcome, I am doubtful anyone will read the manuscript as I post, let alone submit requests, but one never knows when posting things to the internets so we shall see.
