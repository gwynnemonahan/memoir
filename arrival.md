# My Independance Day
(December 7, 2011)

I follow the passengers down the gangway, and up a flight of escalators, most still sleepy-eyed from napping on the first flight from O’Hare to Vancouver International airport. The escalator drops us at the top of a gangway that winds around the departure gates below. Displays extolling the benefits of preservation and conservation give me pause as we walk the length of the terminal. My American brain is accustomed to ads extolling the benefits of data security, local attractions, and a humanitarian effort more than a decade old. The walkway opens into a larger space, a set of monitors devoid of text on one side, a big sign pointing to the left for US connections, another straight ahead for Canadian Customs. 

The last time I passed through a customs checkpoint was on a trip to Europe in 2006 to meet up with my best friend from college. We had made a pact: if I wasn’t able to study abroad before graduation and she snagged the teaching position in France after graduation, then I would visit. Between jobs the first time, we met in Paris. I heard French spoken with a hard accent, like spitting the words instead of caressing them, and marveled at the graffiti that adorned every square inch of wall space along the train tracks leading into Paris. When I returned to the States after visits to London, Dublin, and the southern coast of Ireland, a US Customs agent asked if I had any perishable items and the nature of my trip. No, I did not have any perishable items, and the purpose of my trip was a vacation. Except I had forgotten about two small tangerines I had stuffed in my daypack along the way, which were moldy when I emptied the front pocket of that daypack years later. The moldy residue a constant reminder now whenever I use the pack for a short excursion.

On this December day in Vancouver, in 2011, I cannot lie. I will not lie. I must get this work visa so I can move out of my parents’ house and resume the life of an independent adult as a 30-year-old single woman should.

I have rehearsed. I am prepared. Right? The Prosecution objects.

_You worthless piece of shit. You who has never written a technical document. You think you can pass yourself off as a technical writer? They’ll arrest you for falsifying your application. Throw you in solitary. You’ll pray for the inevitability. You’ll ask for death._

I follow the passengers down another set of escalators to a landing, suitcases too large to fit in overhead bins standing next to them while backpacks adorn the seasoned traveler. The businessmen adjust their suit cuffs and ties, leather briefcases expertly secured across their chests. We all queue for the two escalators that run down and deposit people into the customs line. People weave through as if on their way to a movie premiere or live concert. I am surprised by the friendly nature of everyone as we descend, and wonder if it is always like this here as I try not to panic. The result of months of research, negotiation, and help from an immigration lawyer await.

“Relax,” I mumble to myself as I ride the escalator down. “It is either meant to be, or something else will reveal itself. Now hurry up and find the bathroom.”

_It won’t matter. You’ve been mostly unemployed for the past four years, living in your parents’ house as if a high schooler. Nay, a child. Unwanted. Useless. Worthless. They will see this, like the rest. They will deny you, like the rest. Useless. Worthless. No one wants you._ 

I bite my lip at the truth of those statements and try to find fault with the Prosecution’s logic. I had no say in getting laid off. I had no say in the economy collapsing. I had no say in companies instituting hiring freezes well into 2009 and 2010. It’s not through lack of effort. I’ve applied to jobs. I’ve done the interview gauntlet. None resulted in offers. This, though, this startup is different. They came to me. I’ve been with them for more than a year already. That must mean something, right? 

A woman in high heels, a purse dangling expertly from her wrist, strides confidently to the left, toward the universal signs for the washroom. I follow and pause just inside the ladies’ room. Two women, including the woman in heels, are in front of me, waiting. More women are engaged in various activities at the row of sinks, the dark marble no different than many other airport bathroom; the sinks and soap dispensers motion-activated. Women are giving themselves half baths, others applying fresh eye makeup and lipstick while more exit the stalls and silently squeeze in for a quick wash of hands before shimming out and leaving, hands dripping.

Waiting my turn, I rehearse what I am supposed to say to the customs agent, and remind myself to be professional and courteous. Like it’s a job interview. It is a job interview. An interrogation. A proclamation that I am the best. The best at community management. The best at technical communication. Though I can think of a handful of better people. People with more Twitter followers than I have. People who are better writers. People who do this kind of thing all the time. 

_Of course there are better people. There are always better people. Agents, officials know this. They see a worthless piece of shit like you try to pass off as gold every fucking day. You are no different. You are not special. They will see through you. How worthless you are. How useless. Bouncing from job to job. Pretending you can make a living freelancing. You are a fraud._

“The one over there on the left is open,” a woman behind me says, pointing to an open door.

“Thank you,” I say and hurry over. 

I hang my carryon carefully on the hook and relieve myself. The seat feels warm. The pee is warm. My skin is cold. Hands clammy. Pricks around my eyes force liquid out as snot collects and starts to run out my nostrils. The weight of decisions remains as I blow my nose. The weight of leaving my family remains as I blow my nose. The weight of running headfirst into uncertainty remains as I blow my nose. I take a breath, wipe and flush and exit the stall. I move to an empty sink near the end of the row and wash my hands, the hot water sending prickles through my fingers. I splash some water on my face and reach for a paper towel to dry. I take out my suit jacket from my carry on, pleased it remains unwrinkled as the YouTube video demonstrating how to fold it said it would, and put it on. I comb my fingers through my hair, clearing the part in the middle, straighten my jacket, and give myself a hard look in the mirror. Black dress pants. Black shirt. Gray suit jacket. My necklace with my birthstone hanging out, adding a touch of color. I marvel at how slim I look in these clothes. My cheeks are not as blotchy as I expected after struggling to hold back tears for the four-hour flight. I adjust the collar of my suit coat, smooth out the front, turn and look at the back. Clean. Professional. Exactly as the immigration lawyer said to look.

_Polished shit is still shit. Useless. Worthless._

A woman smiles at me in the mirror. I smile back, grab my carry on and exit the bathroom. 

Throngs of people move about. The line for the ladies room now stretches out the door. Security personnel stand and direct people. Those with Canadian passports move left to the short line. Those with foreign passports move right and bunch up until the people at the front of the line step forward. I get in line for foreigners, wondering if I will one day go through the Canadian line. I snake through the line behind an Asian family, and try to follow their relaxed demeanor. 

As I wait, I stare at the digital board that spans the length of the customs kiosks. It is full of alphanumeric codes for airlines, with arrival times displayed in military time. Or is it the Universal Time Code here? My eyes land on EVA, the code for Evergreen Air, the airline subsidiary of Evergreen Marine. A Taiwanese-owned international container shipping company I worked for my first job out of college, shuffling export Bills of Lading and learning the ins and outs of shipping all matter of goods to every part of the world, along with a whole new vocabulary and that the 26-letter English alphabet requires creative thinking when generating new port codes. Within six months it was clear there was nowhere for me to go in that company. I had mastered my job responsibilities and boredom set in. I stuck it out for a year, believing one year of real-world work experience granted me a ticket to a life I couldn’t articulate. 

_You are a female who prefers pants and modest tops over pencil skirts and low-cut blouses. You prefer comfort and practicality over flouting your sexuality. Your ears aren’t pierced, you don’t wear makeup or perfume. You don’t flirt. Of course they didn’t promote you. Of course you bounce from job to job. Of course you’re worthless. You offer nothing. This will be no different, dressed in your dark pants suit, still no makeup or perfume. Slit your wrists and throat to add some color._

A security agent directs me to the right. I stand in another, shorter line, waiting for a kiosk to open and for an agent to motion me forward. Forward movement is all I know. Every 18 months I move forward, onto another company, another job I master quickly and spend my time searching for another job before boredom takes over. 

I open the folder containing my application papers and skim them one more time. I have been in this job for 14 months now. Fourteen months contracting remote, out of my parents' house, growing the legal tech startup's social media presence, its company blog, and the industry blog I have forged from nothing for them. It will soon become award-winning, on a budget of zero dollars. Fourteen months of steady pay is a Godsend after more than two years without.

I look at the letter from the lawyer, and the offer letter with its corrected annual salary, drawing a blank on whose idea this is, my relocating to Vancouver and becoming a full-time employee. I don’t remember why I decided to do most of the legwork, then agree to hire a lawyer who verified the research I had done. I cannot forget my brothers and father railing against this move. Moving countries for a company that won’t give me a raise, or cover moving costs. Nor can I forget the company sending its offer letter with an annual salary $5,000 less than agreed, the CEO shrugging it off like no big deal, the COO trying to smooth it over and then sending a corrected copy.

_Even they don’t think you’re worth it._ 

I cannot forget the blind faith and encouragement my mother and sister-in-law have provided. I cannot forget the support my mother and sister-in-law give against the rest. They tell me it is my decision. They tell me I must do what I believe. They tell me I must follow my heart. I don’t know what that means. The evidence simply points to Vancouver. It is my best chance at resuming my independence before I turn 30. 

I step forward as instructed and present my papers, along with my passport, to the customs agent. 

“Purpose of your trip?” He asks without looking at my paperwork.

Be calm. Be professional. Be succinct. “To obtain a work permit.”

“Length of stay?” He looks at me. “For this trip.”

“Five days, sir.”

He scribbles on the back of the customs declaration card I had filled out on the plane, hands it back to me along with all my papers.

“Go to the right and look for the Government of Canada signs. They’ll review your application.”

“Thank you,” I say, collecting all the pieces and stepping past the kiosk to make way for the next person. 

I stand and scan for the Government of Canada sign among a multitude of signs displaying flight information above baggage carousels, and airline customer service, in multiple languages. Far off to the right, as if hiding, is a long bank of well-lit windows. I head in that direction and find myself entering another line that snakes through the brightest space in the airport. 

Carts stacked high with bags line the wall, underneath a sign that says “DO NOT LEAVE LUGGAGE CARTS UNATTENDED” in a variety of languages. Long items encased in black sleeves with zippers and handles lean against the wall, or are lain carefully up against the wall, behind the protection of the luggage carts. I stare at them as I wait in line, then look in front of me to see how far the snake goes. I know my mother is waiting to hear from me. I told her I would call when I knew something, but I didn’t know how long the process would take. Nowhere did it say how long the process takes, or what to expect. Only what documents you need and what your options are if you are unable to secure a work visa under a NAFTA designation. 

_There is no hope if you are denied under a NAFTA designation. If you cannot make it through the easiest path, there is no hope for you._

A group of young men are talking and laughing with each other in front of me, their hair long and their skin too tan for December. They speak of lines and slopes, making me think of Accelerated Algebra my freshman year of high school. A new class for a small group of us who scored well on the entrance exam but, as freshmen, not eligible to take Algebra II. Lines and slopes and segments and equations composed of strange symbols that yielded numeric sums as foreign to me as my new surroundings, new routine, new people far from the homogenous Irish Catholic upbringing I understood. Classmates that didn’t celebrate Christmas. Classmates with famous parents. Classmates who drove to school in cars with heated leather seats. Classmates who were legacies. Classmates who valued my opinion. Classmates who marveled at words I put on the page. Teachers who understood a diamond in the rough. Teachers who didn’t judge. 

*snicker* _They judged. They were simply more mature about it, concealing it, pretending to be supportive. You practically failed that algebra class. You practically failed chemistry. You failed to hang yourself. They took pity on your stupidity and your worthlessness._ 

I hear “Whistler” and “Blackcomb” and realize line and slope refer to skiing or snowboarding. Later I learn I arrived with the annual influx of Australians coming to work at the resorts for the winter in a process that is as familiar and routine as waking in the morning. They will lose their long golden locks and trim their beards in exchange for money and free ski passes for the season, then leave for Europe, then Australia again, before coming back to Vancouver, following winter around the globe, chasing the best powder the way surfers chase the best waves. 

When it’s my turn, I greet the Government of Canada official warmly and give him my packet of paperwork. He shuffles through it, asks a couple of questions, makes a crack about my salary being less than his, then turns to his computer screen. I feel my mouth open to defend myself but quickly close it, not wanting to offend the man who decides whether I get a work visa so I can move out of my parents’ house and resume an adult life at the age of 30. I stand stupidly, silently in front of him, waiting.

“You can have a seat,” the agent says. “This will take a few minutes.”

“OK. Thank you.” I move in the direction he points and take a seat in the first row of a roped-off area containing a few others waiting. I watch as he talks to his coworkers on either side of him, laughing about something before shuffling my papers around again. He starts to type, looking down at my papers, holding up the first page of my resume, typing some more. I take a deep breath and look at the clock. Almost two hours have passed since I landed, two years since I got my masters in IT and Privacy Law, three years since I got laid off and moved back in with my parents.

The Government of Canada agent calls my name, hands me back my paperwork in its folder. He staples a colorful piece of paper into my passport, gives it to me, and sends me on my way. I thank him and follow some Australians, fresh with their visas, back out into the airport. I collect the one bag I gate-checked, and follow the signs for the exit.

There’s a large, circular information desk, hallways that lead to other parts of the airport, other departure gates. I stand for a moment, then follow a line of people through sliding doors and out into the waiting area. Families hold up signs written in Asian characters. Chauffeurs hold placards with names. Others sit staring at phones, waiting. 

I step to the side and take out my phone so I can finally call my mother. I go through the phone settings to turn roaming on so I can get a signal, and notice the WiFi signal is stronger. As I dial and wait for her to answer, I look at the colorful piece of paper now stapled to the inside of my passport, granting me permission to live and work in Canada for the next three years.

My eyes land on the issue date: December 7, 2011. My independence day. I am free to resume adulthood before I turn 30. #achievementunlocked
