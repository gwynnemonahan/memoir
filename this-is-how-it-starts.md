 #  This is How it Starts
**(October 2012)**

The opening guitar riff to Linkin Park’s Bleed It Out consumes any thought as I reach Yew and Cornwall and wait for the light to change. _Shotgun opera/lock and load/Cock it back and then watch it go._ I cross and turn left, walking the paved path around Kits Beach, past the pool now filled with waterfowl droppings and algae that turns its blue water various shades of green and a color I can’t place, past the outdoor theatre and pop out at the beach as a moment of silence passes before What I’ve Done seizes my brain. The tide is in, the waves angry. I remove my earbuds, the melody still audible above the waves as they crash against rocks, roll up on the beach and swallow sand while spewing spray that still falls short of sunset watching stragglers. _Erase myself._ My feet pause at the edge of the sand, the waves beckoning as they claw their way up the beach. Wash away. I’m wearing dark clothes. I will get sand in my shoes. My phone and wallet will be ruined by the saltwater. There are people. And Dion is expecting me, as any therapist does when a client has an appointment.

_I start again  
And whatever pain may come  
Today this ends._ 

Earbuds reinserted, the last three notes of Nickelback’s Gotta Be Somebody fading before Burn It To The Ground overpowers the angry waves, I turn and walk away, through the tennis court parking lot, across the street and up to Cornwall again where I turn left and walk past hipster coffee shops, vegan takeout joints and restaurants to Burrard. I stop at the corner, watching traffic ebb and flow with the light as people head downtown for an evening out or home, and think about the height of Burrard Bridge as the opening chords to The Verve’s Bittersweet Symphony gives me pause. My right hand automatically starts counting measures before the first cymbal crash as I follow the WALK sign across the street, down the block to First Ave, hang a left and walk to Pine. Waiting for the light to change, I gaze up Pine. The last leg. Bruce Springsteen’s No Surrender erupts in my eardrums as I walk up the last eight blocks to his office. 

_I can feel my heart begin to pound  
Soldiers in a winter’s night with a vow to defend   
No retreat baby, no surrender._

Outside his office building, I pause, cautiously peeking around the hedges into the lobby. It is empty. Relief exhales. I can vanish, none the wiser. I am early. Linkin Park’s Burn It Down plays as I walk once more around the block before peering in again. He sits on the steps inside the lobby, hands folded, waiting. 

_And you were there are the turn waiting to let me know  
We’re building it up to break it back down  
We’re building it up to burn it down  
We can’t wait to burn it to the ground._

He pops up, smiles and opens the front door. Always a smile. Always a warm greeting. Always an attempt at pleasant conversation. I remove my earbuds and wrap them around my iPod that I slide into the safety of the inside pocket of my black jacket. My answers are monosyllabic as I follow him up the first flight of stairs, pausing on the second step from the top as he inserts keys to open the door. My feet drag behind him, soles brushing the carpet, testing to see if there is enough static to cause a spark for spontaneous combustion as we walk past the waiting area and reception desk and into his office.

_We can’t wait to burn it to the ground._

Still intact, I sit in the black leather chair farthest from him, and farthest from the window. A cabinet stands to my right, its glass doors protecting antique objects he has collected from markets he doesn’t name. The coat rack sits behind me, holding a windbreaker and a bicycle helmet this time. I wonder if it wasn’t raining yet when he started his day. A small table sits to my left, separating my chair from its twin, and I imagine couples sitting in this room, arguing with each other while he plays referee. 

The windows open to the back parking lot, nearly empty at this hour on a weeknight. I glance at the long, low cabinet that sits beneath the windows and runs the length of the room. Multi-colored markers sit at the end of the cabinet, lined neatly in ROYGBIV. A whiteboard juts out from behind the cabinet.

I sit on the edge of the chair, leaning forward, feet elbow width apart, elbows on knees, hands clasped as I grit my teeth beneath sealed lips and take an unnoticeable deep breath. I pull out a racquetball from my jacket pocket, placing it between the index and thumb of my left hand while using the index and thumb fingers of my right to rotate it. Instantly my circulation changes, going from goo to steel, hardening against this voluntary action I have chosen to undertake once a week for the past month, reasoning a neutral third party is the best way to bide my time as the lies I’ve swallowed rot me from the inside out: my failure as a daughter, choosing sports, baseball caps and books over dresses, dolls, and makeup. As a student, a peer, obediently opening myself up to ridicule before fleeing instead of kicking ass. As an undergrad in journalism. Economics. Statistics. My stupidity shining brightly for all to see. 

_Worthless. Useless. Failure. These are not lies. They are statements of fact, including your failure to adapt as an adult and wear makeup and perfume, low-cut blouses and short skirts, clothing fitting of women who want to advance. Your failure to hold a job. Worthless. Useless. These are facts you continually refuse to acknowledge and accept. Dion cannot help you. No one can help you. Only death can save you._

Dion sits quietly, legs stretched in front of him, legal pad on his lap, pen resting in his hand, ready to put ink to paper when my lips form shapes as sounds emanate from my throat. The room is silent, my eyes fixated on the floor, taking in the details of the snarling wolf etched into the carpet from a previous vacuum, its snout inches from my shoe.

This October night, face concealed by my cap, I stare at the wolf, daring it to pin me to the chair and clamp its jaws around my carotid as Dion asks routine, “self-care” questions. I answer mechanically, honestly: Yes, I still show up to work on time. Yes, I perform my duties as expected. Yes, I eat. Yes, I shower. Yes, I go out. Yes, I interact. Yes, I perform all the necessary actions required to portray a functioning human being. I shrug when asked about suicidal thinking. 

“Isn’t that a given?” I rotate and shift the racquetball so the seam runs between my fingers, its imperfections grating against skin, the PENN logo appearing every second turn.

His questions continue tonight, teasing out things I haven’t spoken as he removes the whiteboard from behind the shelf and picks up a marker. Only ROYGIV remains as I am lulled into the comfort of reciting facts, forbidden words forming sentences that touch the air before I can swallow them. He writes as the words fill the space between us for the first time, the marker squeaking randomly as he tries to keep up. Consistent squeaks punctuate the arrows he darkens, illustrating the direction of a circle. 

My back straightens, eyes shift towards the whiteboard, forcing my neck and shoulders to twist. 

The circle he has drawn stares at me.

The knuckles of my left-hand flex and dig my fingers into the racquetball, the force intensifying, straining and fatiguing the forearm muscles as the racquetball refuses to push through my palm and out the back of my hand. No blood gushes out to entice the wolf in the carpet to rise and feed. I stare at the circle, following the arrows, forbidden words describing events of my life filtered down into two-word phrases.

Feels anxious → Lashes out → Feels bad 

My fingers adjust, closing around the racquetball so my thumb is just touching the tip of the middle finger, forcing the tiny tendon fibers to stretch and form a solid connection between thumb and middle finger in an effort to pop the racquetball as the phrase at the end of the circle passes from iris to brain.

Re-enforces negative thoughts. 

Other words are scribbled off to one side. Only “suicidal thinking” is legible.

My eyes traverse the circle on the board again and again.

Feels Anxious → Lashes Out → Feels Bad → Reinforces Negative Thoughts → Suicidal Thinking → Feels Anxious → Lashes Out → Feels Bad → Reinforces Negative Thoughts → Suicidal Thinking → Feels Anxious →

The path sears itself into my brain, examples of the opposite popping forth and opening up an exuberant, triumphant voice in my head, pleased to finally have an ally that gives it strength to materialize and take shape for the first time. My Defense.

_Yes! Finally! That fucking pattern is out in the open. Good job. Good for you. Keep going._

“Have you said any of this before?”

The word forces its way past my lips for the first time. “No.” 

He traces the circle, saying, softly, "Wow. Powerful.” I can see his feet shift in my direction. “How are you doing?”

I swallow but my lips will not part for more words. They bunch up in my brain, the triumphant voice of the Defense straining to push them out to strengthen the lifeline, but the jaw has engaged, shifting, causing a grinding of molars as the tongue moves out of the way and pushes against the front teeth. I feel my jaw slide into place, clench, pulling my eyebrows with it.

“What are you thinking?”

I glance down at the racquetball. My knuckles are white.

His feet point directly at me. “Are you OK?”

The only acceptable answer squeezes out. “Yep.”

I will be punished. 

I must get out.

All of his words of care and concern and the required safety promise he extracts each week do not cross his lips by the time my right-hand grabs and twists his office doorknob and my feet cross the threshold. I hear nothing, my characteristic shuffle replaced by strides, covering the distance from office door to stairwell door in three and a half. I shove the racquetball in my pocket as I turn the top lock and then the doorknob. The door only opens if you turn them together. My foot instinctively pushes on the door as I move to throw my shoulder against it. I must get out. My body tenses at the expectation of his touch, his calming voice, the safety of being understood. He knows what no one should. Mid-thrust, my hands work in tandem, flinging the door open, releasing me to the stairwell I am too balanced to fall down in a manner that will crack my skull, freeing my brain for detailed examination and the shaking of heads and shrugs of indifference as time passes.

The rain beats the brim of my cap before smacking the pavement as I exit the building. Rivers are forming in the gutters, curling and rolling down towards the Pacific Ocean. 

The Defense, exuberant and triumphant, speaks: _Breathe_. 

I keep moving, my strides elongated, my breath ragged, uneven. My feet creep into the street at the intersection of Burrard and Broadway, head swiveling, counting cars and checking the lights at the end. They turn red, and I pause in the middle of the street to let the last car pass before I keep moving. My arms remain tight to my body, shoulders hunched as I traverse the last four blocks with minimum thought of safety at the last intersection.

_Take another breath. It’s OK. Breathe. C’mon. It’s OK. Breathe. C’mon. In….out…..in ...count to five ...out ...in...count to five...out ...It's OK. Breathe. Fuck. Please. Breathe. I’m going to help._

My hands spring from my jacket pockets as I reach the steps to my apartment building, fingers uncurling, revealing keys before smoothly inserting them into the front door, twisting and pulling open in perfect time. My feet move with swiftness up the three flights of stairs and down the hall to apartment 311, keys at the ready to open the solid oak door.

The Defense vanishes as the door closes.

Movements are automatic as I remove my shoes and shed my therapy uniform, the noise in my brain rising, demanding submission to my punishment. My knees give way as I wrap my arms around my head, squeezing, hard, wanting to force the noise out. I suck in my breath, wrinkle my forehead and try to pull my eyeballs out through the back of my skull. My muscles tense, forcing tendons to tighten and fold into themselves, causing my body to curl in on itself, my fingers gripping, squeezing the hood of my sweatshirt as the Prosecution starts.

_You worthless piece of shit. Believing his lies because he possesses a whiteboard and dry-erase markers and the ability to write words and draw circles. Words I have been repeating to you for 20 years, and now you question their validity, you question me? You feckless child. _

_Correct your failures. Throw yourself onto the windshield. Don't curl up or try to protect yourself. Open yourself up to the glory of glass penetrating flesh, bones snapping and pushing through skin, blood running from the fragments, mixing with the rainwater as you roll down into the concrete gutter where you belong._

_Worthless. Failure._

_I will bleed it out of you tonight with the serrated bread knife, but don't be a pussy and slit your wrists over the kitchen sink. I have taught you better. Get a good grip, then jab it into your left side, in between the first and second rib so you can drag it across to your sternum. Do that for three ribs on the left, three on the right, and gut yourself like the worthless pig you are. But let's spill more blood in that godawful pink bathroom._

_Ugly. Like you._

_Fill that filthy tub with hot, scalding water. Feel the burn as you step in, the grime searing onto your flesh before you slice your left thigh, then your right, letting the grit infiltrate the wound, stinging as you slit one wrist, then the other, releasing your worthlessness. If you are still conscious, slit your throat with a deep, long, singular slice, ear to ear. Not the pansy-ass nicks or half slice. Ear to fucking ear. The faster the worthlessness escapes you, the better._

I stare down at the tub. I had cleaned it over the weekend, removing the liner to get at the scum collecting underneath, wiping the tiles down and using a paper towel to shine the spigot as I had done as a childhood chore. The spigots and nozzles in our house always gleamed, even when you looked at them reflected in the mirror. My mother taught me how to apply the appropriate pressure to clean off gunk, fingerprints, and other smudges without the use of chemicals or silver polish. She taught me how to unclog a drain with baking soda and boiling water, how to find studs in the wall for nails to hang mirrors, pictures and hooks, how to remove stains from clothing, how to check the oil of a vehicle, what an engine sounds like when it’s running smoothly, what it sounds like when the fan belt is loose. She taught me the practicalities of being a self-sufficient woman. 

The knife is still clutched tightly in my hand as I push my palms into my eyes. My Defense announces itself with instructions, and I obediently return the knife to is magnet on the fridge. I listen as it pokes holes in each method. 

_It is good you have paused to remember cleaning the tub over the weekend. There is neither filth nor grime. The water from the spigot will not be scalding, either. For water to be scalding, it must be boiling, or reach the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding environmental pressure. That does not happen with water from a spigot in a building like this._

_Let’s go to the sink, turn it on, and think about this logically. Yes, warm water raises body temperature, forcing large amounts of blood quickly to the surface, to help cool the body, but you're standing over a kitchen sink. As you can see, warm sink water just raises the veins in your wrist. It'll take fucking forever to bleed out like that because the rest of your body is still cool. You'll faint, maybe, and bleed out all over the kitchen tile. Granted the red will do wonders for the lame, faded yellow, but the blood will seep into the wood. That'll be a bitch to clean. They'll have to rip everything up. Building will be a biohazard. None of us want that._

_Finally, let’s go out to the deck, and think about this logically. We are only three stories up. There is nowhere higher to climb. A Civic, and an SUV that just pulled in right below all block your path to concrete. They will break your fall, and factoring in gravity plus body mass and laws of physics, you will walk away with maybe a broken bone. If all of your bones are as thick as your Irish skull, you'll do more damage to the car than yourself._

My muscles quiver with exhaustion as I go back inside, water shedding itself from my clothes, my socks leaving perfect footprints across the floor, stopping at the couch where I drop to the floor, bring my knees to my chest and wait for the sun to rise.
