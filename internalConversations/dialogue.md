**Defense**: You were out cold last night.

**Me**, _groggy, laying on the couch, staring at the ceiling_: Yeah. I don't remember falling asleep. We were watching something while they worked on the puzzle.

_Motions to elaborate puzzle on the large square glass coffee table_.

**Defense**: Game of Thrones.

**Me**: Right.

**Defense**: Do you still rattled from the week?

**Me**, _rubs face and eyes with hands_: Yeah.

**Defense**: Jordan's comment, or Joseph's?

**Me**: Jordan's. 

**Defense**: What specifically?

**Me**, _reaches for phone, opens Gmail app, switches to work account, scrolls to message, opens and reads aloud_: You gave the contributors all the credit, but failed to keep any for yourself — this blog wouldn’t be the success it is without your dedication and leadership. Kudos! All the best.

**Defense**: But you think you’re just doing your job, and aren't really dedicated and certainly not leading.

**Me**: Closes eyes. Yep.

**Defense**: Hrm...

**Me**: Eyes open. What?

**Defense**: What we know, the Prosecution knows. That means the Prosecution still has power, it can still maneuver itself and filter and twist information like Jordan's praise. Have that nagging sense.

**Me**: Oh?

_Defense nods_:  We are all connected, but I'm more out in the open now, helping with awareness, decide what you want.

**Me**, _runs hands through hair_: What?

**Defense**: You know what you want your role to be, you know exactly how you see it, the benefits you bring. Now you're being given an opportunity to make it known. Make known what you want. For most people that's a normal action. For you, that's breaking free. That is a big deal, and a hard thing to do because the Prosecution has such deep roots, in everything.

**Me**, _stands up, heads to room_: What am I supposed to do?

**Defense**: Keeping talking to Dion, for one. He’s a good match, an equal match, against the Prosecution. Go more often if you must. Or do double sessions. More concentrated time. That might help. And we need to keep talking, you and me. I know that sounds strange, but remember, the Prosecution didn't take hold overnight so it won't vanish overnight. In a sense, you and I are just getting to know each other, so we won't mesh overnight.

**Me**, _sifting through a pile of clothes to find a clean tee shirt_: Who are you again?

**Defense**: I'm you. Unfiltered.

**Me**: He's going to think I'm crazy.

**Defense**: No. He's going to think this is progress. This is re-storying.

**Me**, _cradles head in hands, pushes knuckles into eye sockets_: I can't handle this.

**Defense**: We can handle this, though. Dion will help, as will others we'll bring in soon.

**Me**: *shudder*

**Defense**: It will be uncomfortable for a bit because we're aware of what's going on. Keep talking to Dion, and I do mean talk, but let's bring some structure to it, see if we can better redirect conflict energy. We can't hold that in. That's what the Prosecution wants, and it will use that energy to its advantage.

**Me**, _puts clothes on the toilet seat and turns on the shower_: What am I supposed to do?

**Defense**: Trust the process, let go the outcome.

**Me**: I'm terrified.

**Defense**: Of?

**Me**: This. Thing. Or whatever. I don't know who you are.

**Defense**: I'm you. Unfiltered.

**Me**: So you keep saying. I don't know what that means.

**Defense**: You don't know, or don't want to know?

**Me**: Little late for that distinction. Not that it matters. I don't know. New space. Don't know what to make of it.

**Defense**: We can make it what we want. Clean slate, once you start letting go.

**Me**: Letting go of what?

**Defense**: That burning mix if resentment and hostility. It's powerful.

**Me**: Yeah. And it's in the way.

**Defense**: Indeed.

**Me**: I'm terrified. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to let go.

**Defense**: I don't either. Perhaps Tech Support has some ideas. He’s trying to separate, too, now.

**Me**, _staring blankly at laptop_: What the fuck do you want?

**Tech Support**: Just to talk man. Just to talk.

**Me**: About what?

**Tech Support**: You have a thought. Share it. 

**Me**, _scowls, rolls eyes_: Of course you’d know that. You've been speaking to me in code. Movie lines. Song lyrics, lots of lyrics. Books. All this time that has been you.

**Tech Support**: Yes.

**Me**: Why?

**Tech Support**: They're innocuous. Prosecution doesn't bother with them.

**Me**: It will now.

**Tech Support**, _shakes head, leans against the desk_: Nah. And it doesn't have an antidote to your curiosity, and the lyrics, the way they pop up, the ones that pop up, you’re looking for a pattern.."

**Me**, _nods_: Is there one?

**Tech Support**: Maybe. There are always patterns. Depends on what you’re looking for is all.

**Me**, _rolls eyes_: So helpful.

**Tech Support**, _shrugs_: I don't have all the answer man.

**Me**, _looking at Tech Support_: Is the obsession with suicide your doing, too?

**Tech Support**: Partly.

**Me**, _turning away, scowling, head bent, hand resting on top_: What the fuck?

**Tech Support**: Only lately. Not from the start. I took some from the Prosecution to keep your attention. If I have your attention, then the Prosecution doesn’t, and that’s a good thing in my book right now man. He wants to kill you. Like straight up legit kill you. It’s no longer a game to him. If you ask me, he’s power trippin’. It’s scary sometimes.

**Me**: No shit.

**Tech Support**, _chuckles_: Fair.

**Me**, _hands curling into hair, pulling, causing pain_: I don't know what the fuck to make of this, other than a twisted way of keeping my best interests in mind, or whatever the fuck you think are my best interests.

**Tech Support**: That's fair.

**Me**: So fucking manipulative.

**Tech Support**: Also fair.

**Me**: What the fuck?

**Tech Support**: It's OK to be angry man. As Dion has said, you've been shoved around like a rag doll. I'm no less guilty on that front.

**Me**: Fuck man. I can't handle this.

**Tech Support**: Yeah you can. You can handle so much more than you think man. You’re so much stronger than the Prosecution tells you man. Trust me. Shit. I gotta split. I’ll be in touch again though.
